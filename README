This is a handy utility to translate text from Japanese to English and vice versa. 
It uses the excite.co.jp services to translate the text then displays the result in 
the standard output.

sadict was created to be integrated with vim and mutt , 
If you add the following lines into your ~/.vimrc 

vmap j :w! /tmp/.vim.msg.en<cr>:!sadic -j  < /tmp/.vim.msg.en<cr>
vmap ,j :w! /tmp/.vim.msg.en<cr><esc>`>o<cr><esc>:r !sadic -j < /tmp/.vim.msg.en<cr>
vmap e :w! /tmp/.vim.msg.jp<cr>:!sadic < /tmp/.msg.jp<cr>
vmap ,e :w! /tmp/.vim.msg.jp<cr><esc>`>o<cr><esc>:r !sadic < /tmp/.vim.msg.jp<cr>

Then you can visually select a text region (by pressing Shift-V then
moving the cursor), then when you press "j" , the text will be translated 
from English to Japanese.

",j" translates the text from english to Japanese then appends the result (japanese text) 
right after the visually selection region.

The "e" and ",e" mappings do the same thing except that they translate text from
Japanese to English.

For Mutt , you can add the following into your .muttrc
macro pager   j          "v\n| nkf -e | sadic -j | less \nq<left>"
macro pager   e         "v\n| nkf -e | sadic  | less \nq<left>"

Then , while viewing your e-mails , you can press "j" to translate from English
to Japanese. and "e" to translate from Japanese to English.
