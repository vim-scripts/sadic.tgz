About : 
------- 

This is a handy utility to translate Japanese text into English one
and also from English to Japanese. It uses the excite.co.jp services
to translate the text then display the result in the standard
output.

The sadic utility reads the text to be translated from stdin. The
default behavior is to translate from Japanese to English but if
you use the  -j option , sadic will translate from English to
Japanese.


Requirements :
--------------

You need to have perl with the perl module " HTTP::Request::Common" installed , a Japanese environment the nkf utility  an
Internet connection.

Installation :
--------------

1- Edit the file "install" and change the variable "prefix" the default
installation path is your home directory $HOME/bin

2- Run the installation script $./install


Usage :
-------

- options :

  If you specify the -j option, sadic will translate the input from
  English to Japanese, if you dont specify the -j option, sadic
  will translate from Japanese to English.

- from a file : you can use redirections to make sadic read the
  text that you want to translate from a specific file.

$sadic [-j] < file 

where file contains the Japanese text that you want to translate.

- interactive : In this mode , sadic read the text to be translated
  from stdin and the result is displayed in stdout.

type

$sadic [-j] 

then enter your Japanese text using the keyboard. when you finish
press CTRL-D

after 2 seconds the text that you types is translated.


Integrating sadic into vim and mutt :
-------------------------------------

1 ) Mutt :
----------

If you add the following lines into your ~/.muttrc 

macro pager   j          "v\n| nkf -e | sadic -j | less \nq<left>"
macro pager   e         "v\n| nkf -e | sadic  | less \nq<left>"

Then , while seeing your e-mails , you can press "j" to translate from english
to japanese. and "e" to translate from japanese to english.


2 ) Vim :
---------

If you add the following lines into your ~/.vimrc 

vmap j :w! /tmp/.vim.msg.en<cr>:!sadic -j  < /tmp/.vim.msg.en<cr>
vmap ,j :w! /tmp/.vim.msg.en<cr><esc>`>o<cr><esc>:r !sadic -j < /tmp/.vim.msg.en<cr>
vmap e :w! /tmp/.vim.msg.jp<cr>:!sadic < /tmp/.msg.jp<cr>
vmap ,e :w! /tmp/.vim.msg.jp<cr><esc>`>o<cr><esc>:r !sadic < /tmp/.vim.msg.jp<cr>

then you can visually select a region of text by pressing Shift-V and then
moving the cursor. 

when you press "j" the text will be translated from english to japnese and then
you will be back to vim.

",j" translated the text from english to Japanese then appends the result after
the visually selection region.

the "e" and ",e" mappings doe the same except that they translate text from
japanese to English.




Important  Note :
-----------------

The tool was testd on a Japanese environment as follows :

Terminal : puttyjp (winxp) with euc-jp as encoding
Shell    : Bash , with LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.eucJP
Remote OS : The sadic was tested using puttyj to connect to a SunOS station
the remote shell is as secified above.




Cheers,
